Dolphins, unlike the cephalopods discussed thus far - the octopodes and squid - are also highly intelligent animals, but as mammals,
the dolphin has a gyrified cortex, which is to say it has convolutions which increase the surface area to volume ratio of the 
cortex, which is thought to be partly responsible for its ability to coordinate highly complex group behaviour. Dolphins function in
a pod, or a collective group, and are very complex creatures.
