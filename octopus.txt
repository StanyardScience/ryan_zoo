The humble (or rather nefarious) octopus is a highly intelligent sea dweller. It is a cephalopod, which is to say it has a 
diffuse series of nerves which constitute several separate brains, each capable of moving independent limbs. Octopodes are
a common neuroscientific model, despite the fact they are invertebrates. They are highly intelligent animals studied for their
social, cognitive and other facets.
